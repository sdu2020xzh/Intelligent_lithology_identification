# Intelligent_lithology_identification
An intelligent lithology identification method is proposed based on the deep learning of rock images. The lithology information and position information in rock images can be predicted using the Faster R-CNN architecture through the RPN proposal generation algorithm and the Fast R-CNN detector.
